# SOLID Typescript: The Reckoning
This is assignment is all about learning.
Which means, I will not care in the **slightest** about the speed of my progress or the result of my project.
My sole focus will be understanding what I'm doing, aspiring to understand the SOLID principles as good as possible, and to soak my brain in the knowledge-juices of articles explaining SOLID.

## Installing Typescript and Parcel
For the first time ever, I can give a shout-out to Past-Besart!
Past-Besart has used both Parcel and Typescript on a previous personal project.
So installing these two will be a lot easier this time!
Once I'm done with installing, I can finally focus on staring at my screen, soaking in SOLID information until the information starts burning through my eyes and goes straight into my brain.

## Learning Experience - How to Experience Learning
As much as I love writing and reading, I just can't learn new stuff purely by reading.
My creative and rebellious brain just doesn't work like that.
But I can trick my brain into learning by writing down everything I've read.
Writing it down as simple as possible really forces me to fully comprehend everything going on.

Not only do I learn that way, other people might also find the way I wrote everything about SOLID principles more understandable than articles.
And if my silly little words can help others, then that's something I can most definitely be proud of.
